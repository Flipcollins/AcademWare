Web Based Application files for project academware

Academware - Primary Schools
AcademWare - Secondary Schools

I developed the project 2 years back on PHP version 5.3 and 5.4 back in 2016, so some of the PHP SQL functions maybe depracated in the latest versions of PHP

To set it up on your local environment, just install xampp running PHP 5.3 or 5.4, then create a blank database captioned capstone within your mysql phpmyadmin environment and import the SQL file located within the database folder of the academware directory. Change your connection mysql connection string to suite your environment in the files named dbcon.php and dbconnector.php within the academware directories. You will  be ready to go

In addition i created a video tutorial based series on my academware youtube channel on how to use the product.
